        <p class="quote">"I’m grateful to FVI and all the professors, like Victor Moreno and Randy Ferrer, for providing me with skills and abilities that helped open the doors to a world full of new opportunities. Coding literally changed my life and has become a powerful tool to grow and improve my life in several aspects. Excellence, knowledge, respect, dedication are the things you’ll find every step of the learning process."</p>
