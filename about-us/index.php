            <p>As you may know, the world of tech presents many challenges, and it can be difficult to keep up with this constantly changing industry. That’s why, at TechLaunch @ FVI we continually refine our curriculum based on feedback from our hiring partners – companies who use technology everyday and can identify skill gaps within the industry. This puts our grads on the cutting-edge of technology and provides them with hard to find skills that employers are looking for.</p>
