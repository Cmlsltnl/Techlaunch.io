            <p>Florida Vocational Institute is accredited by the Council on Occupational Education (COE), a national accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education and licensed by the Florida Department of Education Commission for Independent Education (CIE).</p>
            <p>It is required by the U.S. Department of Education that Florida Vocational Institute reports and discloses specific information about its school’s programs in a clear, prominent, user-friendly, and easily understood manner. The intent of the requirement is to enable students to make an informed choice about a program of study. To this end, Florida Vocational Institute will provide the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Occupations by Program</li>
                <li>Retention Rate</li>
                <li>Graduation Rate</li>
                <li>Placement Rate</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="occupations">1. Occupatons By Program</h3>
            <p>Florida Vocational Institute offers the following approved programs:</p>

            </ul>

            <h3 id="retention-rate">2. Retention Rate</h3>
            <p>Retention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who return to the institution to continue the following fall. The information is reported the U.S. Department of Education via the IPEDS website that is presented on the <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/college navigator/">College Navigator website</a>.</p>
            <p><em>Who is a first-time student?</em></p>
            <p>A first-time student is someone who has had no prior postsecondary experience before enrolling at Florida Vocational Institute.</p>
            <p>Percentage of students who began their studies in the Fall 2014 and returned in the Fall 2015:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Full-time students:  n/a</li>
                <li>Part-time students:  91%</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="graduation-rate">3. Graduation Rate</h3>
            <p><em>Who is considered a completed student? Who is considered a graduate?</em></p>
            <p>A <strong>“completer”</strong> is a student who is no longer enrolled at Florida Vocational Institute and has either completed the time allowed or has completed the graduation requirements for their medical field program. A completer may also be classified as a <strong>“graduate”</strong> if they meet all of the following criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Has achieved a GPA of 2.0 or greater at graduation</li>
                <li>Has successfully passed all required courses in the program</li>
                <li>Has satisfied all other requirements for graduation such as payment of tuition</li>
                <li>Has received the appropriate credentials</li>
                <li>Ceased enrollment in the program at the institution</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>How are graduation rates calculated?</em></p>
            <p>Graduation rates are calculated using the Student Right-to-Know formula in order to comply with U.S. Department of Education requirements. These statistics track all first-time, full-time diploma seeking students who began school during the start date range and reached program completion within the normal time period or normal program length. The graduation rate is the percentage of first-time, full-time students who have completed their program within the normal time period or normal program length.</p>
            <p><strong>*The Institution did not report any first-time full-time undergraduate students in the cohort year; therefore, graduation information was not reported via the IPEDS website.</strong></p>

            <h3 id="placement-rate">4. Placement Rate</h3>
            <p><em>What is the placement rate for graduates of your institution?</em></p>
            <p>Placement rates vary depending on the methods of compiling, calculating, and reporting of data by the regulatory agency or institution. Placement rates are intended to provide information on the number of students who have obtained employment in their field of study after graduation. The rates disclosed below reflect historical outcomes and should not be relied on by anyone as an implicit or explicit representation or promise of future outcomes or employability for any student following completion of a program of study at Florida Vocational Institute. Numerous individual and market factors affect a graduate’s ability to secure employment in his/her field or in a related field after graduation, and the institution has little or no control over many of these factors.</p>
            <p><em>Therefore, Florida Vocational Institute cannot and does not guarantee employment or estimate the likelihood of securing employment upon graduation for any student.</em></p>
            <p>The graduation and placement program data reported in the institution’s 2016 Annual Report filed with the Council on Occupational Education (COE)  is for the reporting period of  7/1/2015 – 6/30/2016.</p>
