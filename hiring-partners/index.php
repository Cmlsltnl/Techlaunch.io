            <p>In a world of ever-changing technology, many corporations are using a larger array of tools and technologies in their daily operations. This makes the hiring process more challenging because, as technology progresses, many candidates have gaps in their knowledge. At TechLaunch @ FVI, we pride ourselves on continually refining our curriculum to give our graduates the real, tangible, relevant skills they will need to complete day-to-day assignments in a working environment. </p>
            <p>Our course provides students with in-depth learning that’s accelerated over six to nine months, going far beyond eight- to ten-week bootcamps that focus on broader technical skills. Before enrolling, potential students undergo a rigorous assessment, and the majority of TechLaunch @ FVI grads stick through nine months of 25+ hours a week of coding while holding down full-time jobs. This grit and determination is a tremendous asset to our hiring partners and their businesses. </p>
            <p>Our training sets our students apart and is designed to prepare them to work in the tech industry. We do this by </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">opportunities to have an impact</h2>
            <p>In the fast-moving world of technology, it’s critical to build a team that can work together towards a common goal. After all, it doesn’t matter how skilled you are if you can’t work with others as a team. Throughout our program, we stress this to our students and spend a significant amount of time emphasizing the essential values that make a team player: humility, ambition, and interpersonal intelligence. By providing these soft skills, we help our grads fit into the world of tech and become valuable team members.</p>
            <p>Many companies and individuals in the tech industry are very socially conscious and understand the skills gap, the digital divide, and the under-representation of minorities in the world of tech. At TechLaunch @ FVI, we prepare every student who has the right combination of skills and grit to succeed in tech. By hiring our grads, you have the opportunity to bring people with diverse backgrounds and ideas into the industry and effect a change for the better that bridges the gaps in the world of tech.</p>
